# GWakeOnLAN
A simple, cross-platform GUI for issuing wakeonlan packets to computers on your network. It also boasts the ability to store all your MAC addresses in a database for easy, distributed and secure access to this important information.

This is a old project that I started as a young software developer, just trying to learn network packets and databases and such. I don't use Wake-On-LAN anymore since I no longer work in IT, so I stopped working on this project long ago, but I figured I'd make the project available to others if they want to use it as a starting point for a better, cross-platform solution.
